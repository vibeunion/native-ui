//! The effect system: TEA's `Cmd` half for `UiApp`.
//!
//! `Effects(Msg)` runs subprocesses, HTTP fetches, and whole-file
//! reads/writes on worker threads
//! owned by the app loop, streams subprocess stdout lines back as typed
//! `Msg` values (or, in `.collect` mode, accumulates whole stdout plus a
//! stderr tail and delivers both on the exit Msg), reports process exits
//! the same way, and delivers each fetch's terminal outcome as exactly
//! one `Msg` — with `.response = .stream` framing the response body into
//! `on_line` Msgs first (the spawn `.lines` contract over HTTP, for
//! NDJSON/SSE endpoints that hold the connection open). File effects
//! (`writeFile`/`readFile`) follow the fetch shape: one bounded
//! operation, one terminal Msg with an explicit outcome
//! (ok / not_found / io_failed / truncated / rejected / cancelled) —
//! TEA-friendly persistence without smuggling an `Io` handle into
//! `update`. Desktop notifications (`showNotification`) are the
//! fire-and-forget exception: the OS owns delivery after the one
//! loop-thread platform call, so there is no meaningful terminal Msg.
//! Invalid requests and unavailable services fail closed; fake execution
//! and session replay never emit a real notification. Clipboard effects
//! (`writeClipboard`/`readClipboard`) keep
//! the same shape over the platform pasteboard — the seam the
//! runtime's cmd+C copy uses — executed synchronously on the loop
//! thread (pasteboards are main-thread services), so apps stop
//! spawning `pbcopy`. The model is
//! never touched off-thread: workers post
//! fixed-size completion records into a bounded MPSC queue, nudge the
//! platform loop through `PlatformServices.wake_fn`, and the loop thread
//! drains the queue and dispatches Msgs through the app's `update`.
//!
//! Design points, mirroring the framework's fixed-capacity philosophy:
//!
//! - Caller-chosen `u64` keys identify effects (store them in the model);
//!   there are no handles to leak. `cancel(key)` kills and reaps.
//! - Execution is thread-per-effect with a hard cap (`max_effects` slots
//!   shared between spawns and fetches). Subprocess streaming and HTTP
//!   exchanges are blocking-I/O-dominated, so a shared pool would need
//!   multiplexing for zero gain at this scale; one thread whose lifetime
//!   equals its effect keeps cancellation and reaping local to a slot.
//!   A real fetch additionally borrows one `std.Io.Threaded` task thread
//!   for the blocking HTTP exchange so the worker can interrupt it on
//!   cancel or timeout.
//! - Overflow is NEVER silent: a spawn that cannot run surfaces as an
//!   `on_exit` Msg with reason `.rejected` and a fetch that cannot run as
//!   an `on_response` Msg with outcome `.rejected`; a line dropped on a
//!   full queue is counted into the next delivered line's
//!   `dropped_before` and the exit's `dropped_lines`; an over-long line
//!   is delivered truncated with `truncated = true`; a response body over
//!   `max_effect_body_bytes` arrives truncated with `truncated = true`;
//!   collected stdout over `max_effect_collect_bytes` and a stderr tail
//!   over `max_effect_stderr_tail_bytes` arrive cut with
//!   `output_truncated`/`stderr_truncated` set.
//! - Spawned children inherit the host process environment (HOME, PATH,
//!   ...): the app runner threads it from `std.process.Init` through
//!   `Runtime.Options.environ` into `bindEnviron`; hosts without a
//!   process `Init` (embed/mobile) get `fallbackEnviron()`.
//! - Cancel semantics: after `cancel(key)` returns, no further `on_line`
//!   Msgs for that spawn are dispatched (already-queued lines are
//!   discarded at drain), and exactly one `on_exit` Msg with reason
//!   `.cancelled` follows once the process is reaped. No zombies: the
//!   worker always waits on its child. A cancelled fetch keeps the same
//!   promise: exactly one `on_response` Msg with outcome `.cancelled`,
//!   and nothing for that fetch after it.
//!
//! Payload lifetime: `EffectLine.line`, `EffectResponse.body`,
//! `EffectExit.output`, and `EffectExit.stderr_tail` point into drain
//! scratch that is recycled on the next drained Msg — `update` must copy
//! what it keeps, exactly like `canvas.TextInputEvent` payloads.
