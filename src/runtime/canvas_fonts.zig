//! Runtime canvas font registry: TrueType faces apps register at startup
//! under a caller-chosen `FontId` (the image-registry spirit — store the
//! id in the model/tokens, no handles to leak) and reference from
//! everywhere a font id rides: `TypographyTokenOverrides.font_id` /
//! `mono_font_id`, draw commands, glyph atlas keys, and render
//! fingerprints.
//!
//! Validation is loud and registration-time only: the bytes must parse as
//! a TrueType face (`canvas.font_ttf.Face.parse`) under the registry
//! bounds — including the glyph-outline budget gate on the face's
//! declared `maxp` maxima (`error.FontExceedsGlyphBudgets` when a face
//! declares denser glyphs than `canvas.font_ttf`'s budgets; the budgets
//! are sized from real CJK faces, so this refuses only outliers) — or
//! registration fails with a recoverable error. A registered id
//! therefore ALWAYS resolves at render time, and the only per-glyph
//! fallback is the same notdef block built-in faces use for codepoints a
//! face does not cover. `canvas.font_ttf.parseFailureReason` turns a
//! rejected file into a teaching sentence, and
//! `canvas.font_ttf.declaredGlyphMaxima` names a budget-refused face's
//! declared numbers, for callers that know the file's name (UiApp's
//! `fonts` option uses both).
//!
//! Both renderers resolve registered ids exactly like built-ins:
//! - The frame planner threads the registered set into
//!   `CanvasFrameOptions.font_resources` for every view, so the CPU
//!   reference paths (presentation, screenshots, goldens) ink the
//!   registered outlines.
//! - Platforms that measure and draw text host-side (`measure_text_fn`
//!   present — macOS) receive the raw bytes through
//!   `registerGpuSurfaceFont` at registration time, before any layout can
//!   measure the id, so host measurement and packet text drawing resolve
//!   the same face. A host that measures text but cannot learn a
//!   registered face fails the registration loudly
//!   (`error.FontHostRegistrationUnsupported`) instead of silently
//!   substituting the default family.
//! - Platforms without host-side text measure through the runtime's
//!   font-aware provider: registered ids charge the parsed face's own
//!   `cmap`/`hmtx` advances (`canvas.estimateTextWidthForFace`), built-in
//!   ids keep the deterministic estimator — measured layout and reference
//!   ink stay in lockstep.
//!
//! Registration is permanent for the runtime's lifetime: glyph atlas and
//! text-layout caches key glyphs by (font id, glyph id) with no content
//! fingerprint, so replacing an id's bytes would serve stale glyphs from
//! retained caches. Re-using a registered id fails with
//! `error.FontIdInUse`; there is deliberately no unregister.
//!
//! Byte storage is on-demand: registration copies the file into an
//! exact-size heap allocation from the runtime's init-frozen
//! `owned_allocator` (captured from `Options.allocator`), so
//! a runtime with no registered fonts carries zero font bytes (embedding
//! hosts create a Runtime per surface — a reservation-shaped pool at the
//! 24 MiB CJK bound would embed 192 MiB in every one). Permanence makes
//! ownership trivial: the bytes live until `Runtime.deinit`, and the
//! parsed `Face` views, the gpu-surface host copy, and the measure
//! provider all borrow them for exactly that lifetime.
//!
//! Capacities follow `canvas_limits` as VALIDATION bounds, not storage
//! reservations: at most `max_registered_canvas_fonts` registrations of
//! at most `max_registered_canvas_font_bytes` each, overflow is
//! `error.FontRegistryFull` / `error.FontTooLarge` — never silent.
