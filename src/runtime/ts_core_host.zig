//! The native host consumer for compiled TypeScript app cores: bridges
//! the versioned command/subscription wire format a compiled core
//! emits (`cmd_format_version` 8) onto the real effect engine
//! (`effects.zig`). The TypeScript tier's core module is a pure
//! Model/Msg/update core whose effects are INERT BYTES — this module is
//! the one place those bytes become engine calls, so the entire
//! existing effects machinery (executors, keyed slots, the completion
//! queue, the session journal, replay) carries TypeScript cores without
//! a parallel engine.
//!
//! `TsCoreHost(core)` is comptime-generic over the core module (the
//! corewire-generated mirror over a compiled archive, or any
//! hand-written module of the same shape) and expects:
//!
//!   core.rt              the core's runtime: `frameAlloc`,
//!                        `frameReset`, `resetAll`
//!   core.Model           the committed model struct
//!   core.Msg             the app Msg `union(enum)` (wire tags are the
//!                        arms' declaration-order indices)
//!   core.initialModel()  `*const Model`, or `InitResult{ model, cmd }`
//!                        for a boot command
//!   core.bootCommand()   the boot `Cmd` without reinitializing the core,
//!                        required when `initialModel` returns `InitResult`
//!   core.update(m, msg)  `*const Model`, or `UpdateResult{ model, cmd }`
//!   core.commitModelRoot the frame-end commit walker
//!   core.subscriptions   optional: `fn (*const Model) []const u8`
//!
//! Like the runtime it drives, a host instance is container-level
//! state — the contract is ONE LIVE APP PER CORE MODULE: two apps
//! over the same core in one process would share a committed root and
//! one set of bridge tables. A compiled archive additionally owns the
//! process's fixed-prefix C ABI symbol set, so a process carries ONE
//! compiled core (each e2e battery is its own binary for exactly that
//! reason).
//!
//! THE DISPATCH CYCLE — every Msg runs update → commit → command walk →
//! subscription reconcile → frame reset, in that order, because the
//! command and subscription bytes are frame-arena resident and must be
//! consumed before the reset. Wire records map onto the engine as:
//!
//!   persist     -> `fx.hostSend("core.persist", core.persistenceSnapshot())`
//!                  — no model bytes ride the Cmd wire; the host asks
//!                  the already-committed core for canonical bytes while
//!                  walking the command.
//!   now         -> `fx.wallMs()` (the journaled clock read) captured
//!                  during the walk; the named arm dispatches with that
//!                  time SYNCHRONOUSLY — immediately after the issuing
//!                  cycle completes, depth-first, before control
//!                  returns to the drain. This mirrors `fx.wallMs`'s
//!                  same-dispatch semantics for Zig cores and replays
//!                  deterministically through the `.clock` journal.
//!   host        -> `fx.hostSend(name, args)` — fire-and-forget; the
//!                  payload is the record's own arg block (`argc` f64
//!                  little-endian values, no count byte), decoded by
//!                  the named service per its build-time contract.
//!   host_bytes  -> `fx.hostSend(name, payload)` — fire-and-forget.
//!   request     -> `fx.hostRequest` with a bridge-assigned engine key
//!                  (`request_key_base` + table index, deterministic in
//!                  issue order). Completion routes the ok/err arm with
//!                  the result bytes; re-issuing a live wire key
//!                  replaces the pending request (the engine drops the
//!                  old result silently) and `cancel` drops it.
//!   read_file   -> `fx.readFile`; the terminal routes the ok arm with
//!                  the content bytes, or the err arm with the outcome
//!                  name as bytes ("not_found", "io_failed",
//!                  "truncated", "rejected").
//!   write_file  -> `fx.writeFile`; the ok arm carries no payload (a
//!                  void Msg arm), the err arm the outcome name.
//!   fetch       -> `fx.fetch` (buffered); an `.ok` un-truncated
//!                  response routes the ok arm as a two-field record —
//!                  the number field gets the real HTTP status (non-2xx
//!                  included), the bytes field the whole body, matched
//!                  by FIELD TYPE, so arm field names are the app's.
//!                  Every other outcome routes the err arm with the
//!                  outcome name; a truncated body routes err
//!                  ("truncated") rather than passing a silently cut
//!                  body as ok. Wire timeout 0 means the engine
//!                  default.
//!   fetch_stream -> `fx.fetch` (`.stream`) through the STREAM table;
//!                  every complete response line routes the line arm,
//!                  and the ONE terminal retires the entry: `.ok`
//!                  routes the HTTP status through the one-number ok
//!                  arm, every other outcome routes the err arm with
//!                  its name. Wire timeout 0 and max-line 0 select the
//!                  engine defaults. `cancel` is loud for a live fetch
//!                  stream: it ends with err "cancelled", with no lines
//!                  after the cancel.
//!   clip_write  -> `fx.writeClipboard` fire-and-forget (`on_result`
//!                  null): a refused or over-bound write is dropped by
//!                  design — there is no route to report on. Engine
//!                  keys rotate through `clip_write_key_base` +
//!                  issue counter so back-to-back writes never collide.
//!   clip_read   -> `fx.readClipboard`; ok arm gets the text bytes,
//!                  err arm the outcome name ("failed", "rejected").
//!   delay       -> `fx.startTimer` (`.one_shot`) in its own slot table
//!                  (`delay_key_base` + index). Fires once, dispatching
//!                  the named arm with the fire time in fractional ms;
//!                  re-issuing a live delay key re-arms the same slot
//!                  from now (the debounce discipline) and `cancel`
//!                  drops it silently (a cancelled delay just never
//!                  fires).
//!   spawn       -> `fx.spawn` through the STREAM table (`spawn_key_base`
//!                  + index) — the one NON-RETIRING entry kind: unlike a
//!                  named op, whose entry retires on its first (only)
//!                  terminal, a stream entry stays live across
//!                  dispatches while `.lines`-mode stdout lines route
//!                  the line arm (line tag 0xFF = no line routing), and
//!                  retires only when the ONE exit terminal delivers —
//!                  a clean `.exited` end routes the exit arm (line
//!                  mode: the code as its single number payload;
//!                  collect mode: a code/output two-field record
//!                  matched by field TYPE, exactly the fetch record
//!                  mechanism), every other end (`signaled`,
//!                  `cancelled`, `rejected`, `spawn_failed`, and a
//!                  collect stdout over the engine bound, reason
//!                  "truncated") routes the err arm with the reason
//!                  bytes. Line/drop truncation flags are not surfaced
//!                  in v1: an over-bound line arrives cut to the
//!                  engine's 4 KiB line bound.
//!   audio_play  -> `fx.playAudio` on the bridge's single audio entry;
//!                  a URL record carrying no cache path plays under the
//!                  engine's conventional content-addressed cache path
//!                  when the wiring configured a caches directory
//!                  (`setAudioCacheDir` / `TsUiApp`'s `audio_cache_dir`)
//!                  — derived bridge-side from the URL alone, so update
//!                  stays pure and replay re-derives identically. The
//!                  entry itself is `audio_key_base` (the engine has
//!                  ONE player, so the bridge holds one stream),
//!                  non-retiring the spawn way, keyed by the wire key:
//!                  every `EffectAudio` event (loaded/position/
//!                  completed/failed/rejected/spectrum) routes the
//!                  event arm — a six-field record built by field NAME
//!                  (state/positionMs/durationMs/playing/buffering/
//!                  bands; `state`'s enum members are matched by member
//!                  name, so the app's declaration order is free) —
//!                  until audio_ctl `stop` (or a replacing audio_play,
//!                  which re-keys and re-routes the same entry) closes
//!                  it. `completed`/`failed`/`rejected` do NOT retire
//!                  the entry: the platform may still speak (soundboard
//!                  starts the next track from `completed`), and stop
//!                  is the explicit close.
//!   image_load  -> `fx.loadImage` keyed by the app's own numeric
//!                  ImageId (the engine registers the pixels under it,
//!                  so the bridge holds a small id->tag table rather
//!                  than minting an engine key). One terminal per load
//!                  routes the event arm — a five-field record built by
//!                  field NAME (id/state/width/height/status; `state`'s
//!                  enum members are matched by member name, and `id`
//!                  echoes the requested ImageId so concurrent loads
//!                  sharing one arm stay distinguishable) — and the
//!                  entry retires on it. A URL record carrying no cache
//!                  path loads under the engine's conventional
//!                  content-addressed image cache path when the wiring
//!                  configured a caches directory (`setImageCacheDir` /
//!                  `TsUiApp`'s `image_cache_dir`), derived bridge-side
//!                  from the URL alone like the audio cache. A
//!                  duplicate LIVE id rejects the new load (the spawn
//!                  discipline: one load per id, never replaced
//!                  implicitly), dispatching state "rejected" at the
//!                  next drain, in command-stream order with the
//!                  engine's own refusals, the refused id echoed; ids
//!                  the wire cannot carry exactly (0, non-integers,
//!                  2^53 and past — the SDK contract is BELOW 2^53)
//!                  reject the same way echoing id 0, and so does a
//!                  17th in-flight load (a full bridge table).
//!                  Image loads are not the string-keyed cancel's to
//!                  end (they are keyed by numeric id, not a wire key)
//!                  — `image_cancel` is their cancel.
//!   image_cancel-> `fx.cancel(id)` on the live load under the id, if
//!                  any: the engine's `.cancelled` terminal routes the
//!                  load's own event arm (state "cancelled") and
//!                  retires the entry, freeing the id for a fresh load
//!                  — LOUD, the spawn cancel discipline. An id naming
//!                  no live load (or one the wire cannot carry exactly)
//!                  is a no-op, audio_ctl's idle rule.
//!   image_unregister
//!               -> `fx.unregisterImage(id)`: free the registry slot
//!                  under the id — registration's synchronous
//!                  discipline in reverse, direct registry surgery
//!                  with no terminal and no Msg. An id with no
//!                  registration (or one the wire cannot carry
//!                  exactly) is a no-op, image_cancel's idle rule. It
//!                  never touches the load table: a load in flight
//!                  under the id keeps running and its terminal still
//!                  registers the pixels — cancel the load first to
//!                  keep the slot free.
//!   channel_open-> `fx.openChannel` keyed by the app's own numeric key
//!                  (the image_load id convention: the raw key IS the
//!                  engine key, and the bridge holds a key->tag table).
//!                  The entry is non-retiring the spawn way: every
//!                  channel event routes the event arm — a five-field
//!                  record built by field NAME (key/state/bytes/
//!                  droppedPending/droppedTotal; `state`'s enum members
//!                  are matched by member name, exactly the
//!                  data/closed/rejected set) — until the one `closed`
//!                  (or a refused open's `rejected`) terminal retires
//!                  it. POSTING is not a TS-tier verb: TypeScript cores
//!                  are single-threaded, so the thread-safe posting
//!                  handle is native-side API (`Effects.channelHandle`)
//!                  for embedders and platform-services extensions —
//!                  the TS tier opens, closes, and receives. A
//!                  duplicate LIVE key rejects the new open (one
//!                  channel per key, never replaced implicitly),
//!                  dispatching state "rejected" at the next drain, in
//!                  command-stream order with the engine's own
//!                  refusals, the refused key echoed; keys the wire
//!                  cannot carry exactly reject the same way echoing
//!                  key 0, and so does a full bridge table.
//!   channel_close-> `fx.closeChannel(key)` on the live channel under
//!                  the key, if any: staged posts flush and the
//!                  engine's one `.closed` terminal routes the entry's
//!                  event arm and retires it. A key naming no live
//!                  channel (or one the wire cannot carry exactly) is
//!                  a no-op, audio_ctl's idle rule. Channels are keyed
//!                  numerically, so the string-keyed cancel never
//!                  touches them — this is their close.
//!   pty_spawn   -> `fx.ptySpawn` through the PTY table (`pty_key_base`
//!                  + index) — non-retiring the spawn way: coalesced
//!                  "output" batches route the event arm across
//!                  dispatches — a six-field record built by field NAME
//!                  (state/bytes/code/reason/signal/droppedWrites;
//!                  `state`'s and `reason`'s enum members are matched
//!                  by member name, so the app's declaration order is
//!                  free) — and the exactly-one "exit" terminal retires
//!                  the entry. An empty wire TERM opens with the
//!                  engine's default (the fetch-timeout convention);
//!                  grid dimensions ride the wire as f64 subset numbers
//!                  and a value the u16 transport cannot carry exactly
//!                  spawns with dimension 0, which the engine answers
//!                  with one "rejected" exit — loud, never a guess. A
//!                  duplicate LIVE wire key rejects the new spawn (the
//!                  spawn discipline: a running terminal's child is a
//!                  running subprocess, never killed implicitly),
//!                  dispatching one "exit" with reason "rejected" at
//!                  the next drain, in command-stream order with the
//!                  engine's own refusals; a full bridge table rejects
//!                  the same way.
//!   pty_write   -> `fx.ptyWrite` on the live session under the wire
//!                  key — fire-and-forget (keystrokes): a key naming no
//!                  open session is a no-op (the exit was already on
//!                  its way), and refused payloads count into the exit
//!                  event's droppedWrites, never silence.
//!   pty_resize  -> `fx.ptyResize` on the live session under the wire
//!                  key — fire-and-forget like pty_write; a key naming
//!                  no open session is a no-op, and a grid value the
//!                  u16 transport cannot carry exactly resizes nothing
//!                  (the no-op rule: there is no honest grid to push).
//!   pty_kill    -> `fx.ptyKill` on the live session under the wire key
//!                  — LOUD, the spawn cancel discipline: the engine
//!                  ends the child and the session's one "exit"
//!                  terminal routes its own event arm with reason
//!                  "cancelled", retiring the entry. A key naming no
//!                  open session is a no-op. Sessions are keyed by
//!                  their own family's verbs, so the string-keyed
//!                  `cancel` record never touches them — pty_kill is
//!                  their kill, the way audio_ctl stop is audio's
//!                  close.
//!   audio_ctl   -> the engine's control verbs (`fx.pauseAudio`/
//!                  `resumeAudio`/`stopAudio`/`seekAudio`/
//!                  `setAudioVolume`), gated by the wire key: a verb
//!                  whose key does not name the open stream is a no-op
//!                  (the playback it aimed at is gone). `stop` also
//!                  retires the bridge entry — no events for that key
//!                  after it.
//!   video_load  -> `fx.loadVideo` on the bridge's single video entry.
//!                  The engine key is `videoKeyForTag` (the
//!                  `video_key_base` namespace with the load's event
//!                  tag in the low byte; the engine has ONE player, so
//!                  the bridge holds one stream), non-retiring the
//!                  audio way, gated by the wire key for verbs: every
//!                  `EffectVideo` event (loaded/position/completed/
//!                  failed/rejected) routes the arm of the load whose
//!                  key it echoes —
//!                  a seven-field record built by field NAME (state/
//!                  positionMs/durationMs/playing/buffering/width/
//!                  height; `state`'s enum members are matched by
//!                  member name, so the app's declaration order is
//!                  free) — until video_ctl `stop` (or a replacing
//!                  video_load, which re-keys and re-routes the same
//!                  entry) closes it. The record's surface is the
//!                  app's own media-surface id (decoded frames flow
//!                  platform-side into that texture channel, never
//!                  through this bridge); an id the wire cannot carry
//!                  exactly reaches the engine as 0, which it refuses
//!                  with one `.rejected` event — never silent.
//!                  `completed`/`failed`/`rejected` do NOT retire the
//!                  entry: stop is the explicit close, audio's rule.
//!   video_ctl   -> the engine's control verbs (`fx.playVideo`/
//!                  `pauseVideo`/`stopVideo`/`seekVideo`/
//!                  `setVideoVolume`/`setVideoMuted`/`setVideoLoop`),
//!                  gated by the wire key: a verb whose key does not
//!                  name the open stream is a no-op (the playback it
//!                  aimed at is gone). `stop` also retires the bridge
//!                  entry — no events for that key after it.
//!   window_show -> `fx.showWindow(label)` — fire-and-forget, label-
//!                  addressed like the Zig tier's verb: un-hide +
//!                  activate (the tray "Open" consequence of the
//!                  menu-bar-app loop). No result Msg; the window's own
//!                  frame event carries the state.
//!   window_hide -> `fx.hideWindow(label)` — retain the live window and
//!                  its views while ordering it out; window_show is the
//!                  inverse.
//!   dock_presence -> `fx.setDockPresence(visible)` — macOS regular/
//!                  accessory activation-policy switch; unsupported
//!                  hosts safely ignore it.
//!   quit_app    -> `fx.quitApp()` — the graceful terminate through the
//!                  same shutdown path a last-window close takes.
//!   show_notification -> `fx.showNotification` fire-and-forget; invalid or
//!                  unavailable requests fail closed, and replay suppresses
//!                  the external user-visible side effect.
//!   cancel      -> by wire key, first match wins in this order: the
//!                  request table (`fx.cancelHostRequest`, silent), the
//!                  named-op table (the entry is marked dropped and
//!                  `fx.cancel` issued — the engine's `.cancelled`
//!                  terminal retires the entry and the bridge swallows
//!                  it: SILENT, no arm dispatches), the stream table
//!                  (`fx.cancel` — the child dies and its exit routes
//!                  the err arm with "cancelled"; killing a process IS
//!                  an observable event, so spawn's cancel stays loud),
//!                  the delay table (`fx.cancelTimer`, silent). The
//!                  audio and video streams are not cancel's to end —
//!                  their ctl `stop` records are their closes.
//!
//! THE KEYED-EFFECT DISCIPLINE is ONE rule across request, read_file,
//! write_file, fetch, clip_read, and delay: a keyed effect REPLACES its
//! live predecessor (the superseded effect's result is dropped — no
//! message), and `cancel` drops it silently (no terminal arm dispatch).
//! For the named ops the bridge implements the drop by marking the
//! superseded entry dropped and cancelling its engine call; the
//! engine's `.cancelled` terminal retires the entry and its Msg is
//! swallowed before dispatch. The ONE exception is a live `Cmd.spawn`
//! key: a duplicate REJECTS the new spawn — its err arm dispatches
//! with "rejected" on the next drain, at the refusal's command-stream
//! position (see the rejection-ordering paragraph below) — because a
//! running subprocess is never killed implicitly; cancel it first. And
//! spawn's explicit cancel stays loud (err arm "cancelled"), because
//! killing a process is an observable event.
//!   Sub timer   -> `fx.startTimer` (repeating) with a fixed slot table
//!                  reconciled by wire key: a new key arms the first
//!                  free slot (slot order — deterministic, never hash
//!                  order), a changed interval re-arms the same slot, a
//!                  tag-only change re-routes without re-arming, and a
//!                  key absent from the set cancels. Each fire
//!                  dispatches the named arm with the fire time in
//!                  fractional milliseconds.
//!
//! THE RESULT-ORDERING CONTRACT: routed results and timer fires are
//! ordinary engine completions — they queue in completion order and
//! dispatch when the host drains (`Effects.takeMsg`, i.e. UiApp's
//! `.effects_wake` and presented-frame drains), exactly like Zig-core
//! fx results. The bridge adds no scheduler of its own; the one
//! deliberate exception is `now` (above), which is synchronous the way
//! `fx.wallMs` is. Bridge-refused rejections (spawn/image/channel)
//! stage into the ENGINE's loop-side pending order at refusal time
//! (`Effects.stageLoopMsg`) and dispatch at the next drain — the same
//! delivery moment as the engine's own refusals, so a `Cmd.batch`
//! whose records are refused by DIFFERENT layers (the bridge's table
//! validation, the engine's cross-family key gate) still dispatches
//! its rejections in COMMAND-STREAM order: one seq-ordered stream is
//! the ordering authority for every rejection, `Cmd.batch`'s
//! performed-in-order contract extended to refusals. A second
//! delivery moment is exactly how families fall out of stream order,
//! so a new refusing family joins by staging, never by dispatching
//! from its own boundary.
//!
//! Result payload lifetime: the engine's result bytes are drain
//! scratch, but a routed result's bytes become a Msg payload the core
//! may store in the model — so the Msg constructors copy them into the
//! core's frame arena first, where the commit walkers classify them as
//! frame-resident and copy whatever the model keeps into the heap.
//!
//! Malformed wire bytes are teaching panics, not error codes: the only
//! producer is the compiled core's own runtime builders, so a bad record is a
//! build-pipeline bug the app author must see immediately.
