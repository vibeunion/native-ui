// @native-sdk/core — the SDK module an app core imports. The subset program

//
// `Cmd` is the typed-effects surface (spec section 2): `update` (and, since
// v2, `initialModel`) may return `[model, cmd]`, where the cmd is INERT DATA
// describing effects for the runtime to perform after the returned model
// commits. Commands are built only from these factories, and only in that
// return path (NS1017) — they never live in the Model, in a Msg, in a local,
// or in a helper.
//
// The v5 command set:
//
//   Cmd.none                     no effects (what a bare `return model` means)
//   Cmd.persist()                ask the host to persist the committed model
//   Cmd.now("tick")              request a timestamp; the runtime dispatches
//                                the named Msg arm with the time (ms) as its
//                                single number payload field
//   Cmd.host(name, ...args)      a host command by name with scalar args —
//                                the host interprets the name
//   Cmd.host(name, payload)      the same, carrying one bytes payload — a
//                                Uint8Array, or a flat record of number /
//                                boolean / Uint8Array fields that lowers to
//                                bytes (hostRecordBytes below)
//   Cmd.request(name, payload,   a routed host command: the host performs it
//               { key?, ok, err })  and dispatches the `ok` Msg arm with the
//                                result bytes, or the `err` arm with the error
//                                bytes — each arm carries exactly one
//                                Uint8Array payload field, checked by tsc. The
//                                optional `key` names the in-flight effect:
//                                re-issuing a live key replaces it, and
//                                Cmd.cancel(key) drops it.
//   Cmd.cancel(key)              drop the in-flight keyed effect — request,
//                                readFile/writeFile/readFileStream/fetch/
//                                clipboardRead, or
//                                delay — SILENTLY (no terminal arm dispatch).
//                                Aimed at a live spawn, streaming fetch, or
//                                streaming service or write-file sink it
//                                stays LOUD: the err arm runs with
//                                "cancelled" — ending a stream is observable
//   Cmd.batch([a, b, ...])       several commands from one dispatch
//
// The named engine ops (each maps onto the host's effect engine directly;
// routing follows the request rules — string-literal arm names, tsc-checked

//                                current locale and time zone
//   Cmd.delay(key, ms, "fired")  a keyed ONE-SHOT timer: dispatches the named
//                                arm once after `ms`, with the fire time (ms)
//                                as its single number payload; re-issuing a
//                                live key re-arms from now (debounce), and
//                                Cmd.cancel(key) drops it silently

// The streaming ops (one issue, MANY result Msgs across dispatches, a keyed
// lifecycle the app drives):
//
//   Cmd.spawn(argv, { key?, stdin?, line?, exit, err })
//   Cmd.spawn(argv, { key?, stdin?, collect: true, exit, err })
//                                run a subprocess. Line mode streams each

//                                field; omit `line` to drop lines); collect
//                                mode buffers whole stdout instead. Exactly one

//                                `exit` — line mode: one number field (the exit
//                                code); collect mode: a two-field record, one
//                                number (the code) and one Uint8Array (the
//                                collected stdout), matched by type — and every
//                                other end dispatches `err` with the reason
//                                bytes ("signaled", "cancelled", "rejected",

//                                surgery like registration itself — not an

//                                (the five-field record below) with the

//                                POSTING is not a TS verb — transpiled cores
//                                are single-threaded by design, so the

//   Cmd.channelClose(key)        close the open channel under the key, if

//                                dispatches the event arm, and the key

//                                keystrokes and pastes, fire-and-forget: a
//                                key with no open session no-ops, and
//                                refused payloads count into the exit's
//                                droppedWrites, never silence.
//   Cmd.ptyResize(key, cols, rows)
//                                push a new grid to the session so the child
//                                receives SIGWINCH — fire-and-forget like

//                                no-ops.
//   Cmd.ptyKill(key)             terminate the session's child — LOUD, the
//                                spawn cancel discipline: the session's one
//                                "exit" terminal arrives through its own
//                                event arm with reason "cancelled" and the
//                                key frees once it lands. A key with no open
//                                session no-ops. Sessions are their own
//                                family's to end: the string-keyed
//                                Cmd.cancel never touches them, the way
//                                Cmd.audioStop is audio's close.
//
// The window verbs (fire-and-forget, no result Msg — the window's own
// frame event carries the state):
//
//   Cmd.showWindow(label)        un-hide + activate the window with the
//                                declared label — the counterpart to a
//                                `close_policy = "hide"` hide and the tray
//                                "Open" consequence; also restores a
//                                minimized window. An unknown label is a
//                                no-op.
//   Cmd.hideWindow(label)        order a live window out while retaining
//                                its views; showWindow is the inverse.
//   Cmd.setDockPresence(visible) show or remove the app from the macOS
//                                Dock/app switcher.
//   Cmd.quitApp()                graceful terminate, the tray "Quit"
//                                consequence: the host quits through the
//                                SAME shutdown path a last-window close
//                                takes, so the stop hook runs exactly once
//                                and a recording session seals its journal.
//
// The keyed-effect discipline is ONE rule: a keyed effect REPLACES its live
// predecessor (the superseded effect's result is dropped — no message), and
// Cmd.cancel drops it silently. That holds for request, readFile, writeFile,
// readFileStream, buffered fetch, clipboardRead, and delay alike. A reissued
// readFileStream key retires the old read silently and starts the replacement.
// Live spawn, streaming-fetch, streaming-service, and write-file SINK keys are
// the exceptions: a duplicate REJECTS the new stream/sink so two producers are
// never spliced. Cancelling a sink is loud (`err: cancelled`) because a
// half-written export is observable; cancelling a read stream is silent.
//
// `Sub` is the recurring-effects surface: an app may export
// `subscriptions(model): Sub<Msg>` returning declarative descriptors the
// host reconciles after every commit (Sub.timer fires the named arm with the
// current time on each interval). Like Cmd, Sub values are inert data, legal
// only in that function's return path (NS1025). Sub and the streaming Cmds
// are different animals on purpose: a Sub is DECLARED from the model (the
// host starts/stops it by reconciliation; the app never opens one), while
// spawn/audioPlay/videoLoad streams are Cmd-INITIATED — imperative opens
// with a keyed lifecycle the app drives and cancels.
//
// The factories return plain frozen-shape objects so the same core runs
// under node: a dev harness can interpret the `op` tags directly.

// The byte-text method surface (s.toUpperCase(), s.split(sep), ... on
// Uint8Array): the transpiler adds the ambient file to every core's program
