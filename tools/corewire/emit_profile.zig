//! core_profile.json emission: the compiler profile that configures a
//! library-mode build of the generated facade. One sidecar, three
//! projections — the host imports core_shim.zig, a compiler consumes
//! core_facade.ts, and this profile tells that compiler's library mode
//! what to build: the entry module, the C symbol family (the ABI's
//! mode-provided symbols plus the export map binding every facade
//! export the sidecar attests to its marshalled signature), the
//! contract-sidecar emission the same invocation must produce, and the
//! SDK's determinism policy (fences, teachings, remediations).
//!
//! The emission is deterministic: a pure function of the contract facts
//! and the entry-module name, fixed key order, no timestamps or
//! environment — re-running the identical invocation reproduces a
//! byte-identical file, the same doctrine the sidecar emitter follows.
//!
//! Marshalled signatures use the v1 classes only (params f64/bool/
//! string/bytes/u8/u32/i32; returns those minus the integer plumbing
//! classes, plus void). The wire-shaped channel entries are expressible
//! in exactly these classes — bytes ride buffer parameters, the
//! modifier booleans u8, the pinch phase u32 — which is the point of
//! the wire shape: a union-typed parameter has no marshalling class and
//! never becomes one.
