# Native SDK

## VibeUnion Foundation Layer

This repository tracks a reusable cross-platform UI foundation on top of
Native SDK 0.9.5. It keeps application state in the caller-owned TypeScript
core and adds no second reducer, product store, browser runtime, or product
backend authority.

The public foundation contains:

- a machine-checked GPUI parity registry for all 42 public Zed UI modules and
  all 57 public `gpui-component` UI modules pinned by
  [`docs/GPUI_UI_LIBRARY_PARITY_CONTRACT.md`](./docs/GPUI_UI_LIBRARY_PARITY_CONTRACT.md);
- the absorbed cross-platform shortcut-capture capability contract, including
  lifecycle, focus ownership, one-shot capture, and the reserved `__capture__`
  command; macOS and Windows system engines implement it today, while Linux
  and Chromium-backed hosts report it unsupported;
- [`patches/native-sdk-0.9.5-runtime-foundation.patch`](./patches/native-sdk-0.9.5-runtime-foundation.patch),
  which adds a thin app-owned host extension, viewport-aware composition,
  bounded native surface input hooks, secure session-input handling, retained
  text-edit after-state, an atomically published host-worker wake seam,
  exactly-once host teardown, and automation input pacing;
- [`patches/native-sdk-0.9.5-compiler-tooling.patch`](./patches/native-sdk-0.9.5-compiler-tooling.patch),
  which keeps compiler stack usage bounded for large cores, permits supported
  `DataView` decoding, and hardens external-core staging.

Start with the [`Foundation Layer Guide`](./docs/FOUNDATION_USAGE.md) for
prerequisites, immutable pinning, ordered patch application, `ts_host.zig`
integration, platform support boundaries, release evidence, upgrade procedure,
and rollback. The normative ownership and acceptance rules remain in the
[`Public Foundation Contract`](./docs/PUBLIC_FOUNDATION_CONTRACT.md).

The patches apply in manifest order to the exact foundation revision recorded
in [`patches/manifest.json`](./patches/manifest.json). Validate provenance,
hashes, clean application, wire stability, and public-boundary scans with:

```bash
scripts/check-foundation-patches.sh
```

Add `--verify` for focused compiler/runtime tests or `--full` for the complete
Zig suite. Product-specific replay fixtures, environment policy, screen
capture prototypes, undeclared platform features, vendored compiler output,
and journal-format migrations are intentionally excluded.

UI-library parity is a platform-neutral API and ownership claim, not a claim
that every OS backend has identical accessibility, text, IME, packaging, or
custom-host evidence. See the guide and
[`Platform Support`](https://native-sdk.dev/docs/platform-support) before
making a platform release claim.

**Native SDK is the complete toolkit for building native desktop applications.**

Native SDK exists because expressive UI and native performance should not be competing goals. Developers often choose web-based runtimes because they offer freedom, speed and control over the product experience. But that freedom often comes with a heavy runtime. Native SDK keeps the expressive authoring model and replaces the runtime with native rendering.

Views are declarative markup in `.native` files, logic is plain TypeScript compiled to native code at build time — or Zig, first-class by choice — and Native SDK's own engine draws every pixel into real OS windows. No browser, no WebView, no JS runtime in the binary: Zig is how everything works, TypeScript and Native markup are how apps are authored.

## Quick start

Install the CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @native-sdk/cli
```

Create and run an app:

```bash
native init my_app
cd my_app
native dev
```

A native window opens with a working counter. The whole app is three files of truth — view, logic, manifest — and no build config. The view is `src/app.native`, a markup file that binds values and dispatches messages (the counter row at its heart):

```html
<row gap="8" main="center" cross="center" grow="1">
  <button variant="secondary" on-press="decrement">-</button>
  <text>{count}</text>
  <button variant="primary" on-press="increment">+</button>
</row>
```

All logic lives in `src/core.ts`: a `Model` interface, a `Msg` union, and one pure `update` function — the only place state changes, plain TypeScript compiled to native code at build time:

```ts
export function update(model: Model, msg: Msg): Model {
  switch (msg.kind) {
    case "increment":
      return { ...model, count: model.count + 1 };
    case "decrement":
      return { ...model, count: model.count - 1 };
    case "reset":
      return { ...model, count: 0 };
  }
}
```

Prefer Zig for the core? `native init my_app --template zig-core` scaffolds the same app with `src/main.zig` — same loop, same runtime, first-class by choice.

Edit `src/app.native` while `native dev` runs and the window updates in place, keeping your state. `native dev --core` runs the TypeScript core under node for instant logic checks, `native check` validates the core and every view in milliseconds without building, and `native build` produces an optimized release binary.

## What you get

**Beautiful by default** — Great software should not start from a blank slate. The built-in component catalog — buttons, tabs, text fields, dialogs, charts, virtual lists, and more — ships with considered typography, spacing, and color, so the app `native init` scaffolds already looks intentional the first time its window opens.

**Customizable by design** — Your app should have its own identity, not ours. Styling is design tokens end to end: color, radius, and typography resolve by name, re-resolve live when the theme changes, and can be replaced wholesale — `examples/soundboard` and `examples/deck` are the same music player separated only by tokens and a chrome pass.

**Native from the start** — Every interface is rendered without a browser or WebView. The engine draws into real OS windows while scroll physics, menus, dialogs, the tray, and text input stay with the operating system, and markup compiles into the executable at build time, so a release build carries no parser or interpreter — the scaffolded counter app builds to a single binary a few megabytes small.

**Predictable state** — State changes should be explicit, inspectable and easy to reason about. Events produce messages, messages update state, and state renders the interface; markup can bind and dispatch but never mutate. The loop is so deterministic that `native automate record` journals a session and `replay` reproduces it headlessly, verified frame by frame against state fingerprints.

**Simple authoring** — Interfaces should be easy to read, easy to write and easy to generate. Views are elements, flex layout, `{bindings}`, and expressions like `selected="{f == filter}"`, and `native check` validates every view against your app's actual `Model` and `Msg` — bindings, iterables, message tags — in milliseconds, with `file:line:column` errors that teach.

**AI is part of the workflow** — Native SDK is designed for a world where humans and AI agents build software together. Every app embeds an automation server, so any agent can read accessibility snapshots, drive widgets, assert on live state, and take deterministic screenshots of the running window; accessibility findings are machine-checked in `native check`; and the CLI ships the agent skills that teach all of it (`native skills list`).

## Examples

The apps pictured above live in [examples/](./examples), most as zero-config projects with a manifest plus `src/` and no build files, run straight from their directory with `native dev`. Many examples predate the current `app.json` default and retain `app.zon`; both formats have the same capabilities. Start with the TypeScript examples when learning the primary authoring path. The `-ts` suffix on `soundboard-ts` and `system-monitor-ts` is historical because those apps are ports kept beside older Zig originals. Chatbot is TypeScript-only and follows the unsuffixed naming used by new apps created with `native init`.

| Example | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| [`chatbot`](./examples/chatbot) | TypeScript + Native markup end to end: modules, a text editor, streaming fetch effects, and replay-safe configuration. |
| [`soundboard-ts`](./examples/soundboard-ts) | The full music-player showcase in TypeScript + Native markup: audio, search, assets, timers, and context menus. |
| [`system-monitor-ts`](./examples/system-monitor-ts) | A live process monitor in TypeScript + Native markup: subprocess effects, tables, charts, and timers. |
| [`calculator`](./examples/calculator) | A complete small app: markup keypad, keyboard input, chrome shortcuts, theming. |
| [`notes`](./examples/notes) | Persistence through the effects channel: debounced writes, restore on boot, dialogs, search. |
| [`soundboard`](./examples/soundboard) | Album grid with decoded cover art, context menus, timers, and a custom theme. |
| [`deck`](./examples/deck) | The soundboard player rebuilt as a dense hardware chassis: two windows, same widgets, different tokens. |
| [`feed`](./examples/feed) | A 100,000-row list, virtualized with runtime-owned scrolling. |

The unsuffixed showcase apps above predate the TypeScript default and retain their Zig cores as first-class alternative implementations. The full catalog in [examples/README.md](./examples/README.md) also covers guarded OS capabilities, GPU surfaces, WebView composition, web-frontend shells, and the iOS/Android embed hosts.

## Platforms

macOS is the primary development platform and carries the deepest support: Metal presentation, OS scroll physics, native context menus, app menus, tray, and dialogs. Linux runs the full showcase through the deterministic software renderer in real windows, with pointer, keyboard, scroll, native context menus, IME composition, and HiDPI; Windows runs on a Win32 host with native context menus and IME composition and is exercised in CI, including real input injection. Mobile support is experimental: iOS is simulator-proven through the embed library and Android cross-compiles with the full embed ABI, but APIs and tooling on both are still evolving — desktop is the mature surface. WebView surfaces coexist on every desktop platform. The [platform support matrix](https://native-sdk.dev/platform-support) documents exactly what each host supports today.
